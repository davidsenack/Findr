# Findr

Findr is a simple image search page written using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
This site allows users to search for random images based on Unsplash.com's random image tool.
Users can search for images based on keywords and view an unlimited number of randomly generated
images based on those keywords. 

This is a personal project for learning more about HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. A few more 
functions may be added at a later date. Possible updates include a modal image view and download functionality. 

This site is availble to view live [here](https://davidsenack.github.io/image-search/).
